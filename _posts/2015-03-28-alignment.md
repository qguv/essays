My friend [recently posted][the original] about [systems of alignment][WP
alignment] like those found in tabletop games. They mention a conversation I had
with someone else, and I'd like to clarify my views a bit and propose some
theories about character alignment and harmony in fiction.

See [the alignment bible][tvt alignment] for more examples of characters and
plot impliciations.

First, some background.

## Alignment and the 9-Cell Grid

Gary Gygax's 1978 update to the Player's Handbook for the release of _Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons_ introduced what we now know as the basic character alignment
system. The vertical axis represents a character's Good/Evil alignment, never
precisely defined but relatively obvious. Good characters generally work for the
common good, while Evil characters tend to focus on their own goals. The
horizontal axis represents a dichotomy between Lawful characters, those who act
predictably or stay within the confines of what is acceptable, and Chaotic
characters, those who don't.

While character alignment is an _amusing and convenient shorthand,_ please don't
actually write or play characters this flat and predictable. 👍

The Web is full of completed 9-cell grids, classifying characters from a host of
media: films, books, television series. All the guides in this post are from
various corners of the Internet&mdash;I didn't make these myself. Here's one
from _Breaking Bad,_ one of very few shows whose main character isn't _Neutral
Good_ or _Lawful Good:_

![Breaking Bad Alignments][breaking bad]

We get a sense from this diagram that the characters are well developed, and
that very different characters can complement each other nicely.

There are an endless number of these diagrams on the internet, ranging from the
[Original Star Trek][tos] to [Web browsers][browsers]. Some even play with the
format of the 9-grid to fit more characters, like the character-heavy [Game of
Thrones][got-complex] (though I worry that Moral is being conflated with Lawful
here, compare a [simpler grid][got-simple]).

The labels themselves are a convenient way to both categorize characters within
a canon and group similar characters from different canons. Not only can we talk
about the group dynamics of the crew of the Serenity with respect to their
alignments, we can also make insightful comments about the similarities and
differences between portrayals of Chaotic Good in each Star Trek series. And if
I can elevate my Netflix habit to the domain of intellectual conversation, it'll
at least make me feel better about it.

## Not All Alignments Are Equal

TVTropes [tells us][tvt hero]:

> A Hero Protagonist is when The Hero and The Protagonist are the same person.
> This combination of roles is extremely common, to the point where it's
> considered true unless otherwise noted within any work. Simply put, the
> central character is also an established force for good within the universe.

This means that our protagonist is _probably_ going to end up on the top line of
our grid. She might be stuck up and/or reserved, which would put her in clearly
Lawful Good territory, or she might be edgy and a little rogue but with a good
heart, which would put her closer to Chaotic Good. If she has sidekicks with
well-established Chaotic and Lawful tendencies, she may end up in the middle as
Neutral Good, mediating between one Lawful and one Chaotic advisor. More on this
later.

There are a couple spots on the grid which don't lead to very good protagonists,
mostly because they've become so clichéd or don't allow for serious character
development. Others are particularly well-suited for character development and
plot advancement.

Let's say you're a writer, and you want an interesting protagonist.

  - **Lawful Good** is out because it's boring and the character has nowhere to
    go but "down" on both fronts. you also risk being too stuck up and
    unwilling to compromise with the more chaotic forces for good in the story
    that the job can't get done for lack of support.
  - **Chaotic Good** is all right, and this is one way to write the antihero,
    but you risk being too edgy and isolating the other real forces for good in
    the story so that the job can't get done for much the same reason as the lawful
    good hero. you also risk being cliché-edgy.
  - **Neutral Good,** the force for good by any means necessary, is a pretty
    good choice because it keeps your character *flexible* while maintaining
    the hero-protagonist role.
  - **Lawful Neutral,** the force for order above all else, is a great choice
    because it sets your protagonist up to display and perhaps overcome an
    initially cold, detached nature. this also forces the protagonist to do evil
    things sometimes, which keeps the character *flexible.*
  - **Chaotic Neutral** can be tough to write and risks being clichéd as the
    "troubled character" which can turn out as well (jesse from breaking bad)
    as it can exhausting and flat (cobb from firefly). this character can also
    *develop,* is *flexible,* and can be convinced to fight for the good guys if
    it's risky or dangerous or wild enough for them. the other way to write the
    antihero.
  - **True Neutral** is probably not suitable for a protagonist, since it means
    that the character breaks the scale in one way or another; they're either
    very self-serving or focused on something very specific. can be hard to relate
    to, but can be fascinating if played right. deserves its own post.
  - **Lawful Evil** can be fun and terrifying to write and watch. _house of
    cards_ abuses this alignment to great effect. this works well because evil
    tends to seek power while lawful is in a position to dole it out.
  - **Chaotic Evil** is generally stupid and overdone. it's not suitable for a
    protagonist, and chaotic evil characters aren't really good villains
    either. if they're truly evil _and_ chaotic, how could they have established
    the power necessary to pose a real threat, since this usually involves allying
    with the traditionally more powerful lawful groups? sometimes chaotic evil
    will pose a final hurdle for the hero before fighting the real mastermind
    (consider in samauri champloo, the crazy short guy mugen fights before meeting
    the calculating mastermind in the church, think of baby bowser before bowser,
    remember the hundreds of raging baddies you battle on your way to the final
    chamber in kotor ii, and for that matter in any game).
  - **Neutral Evil** is the other really effective villain; we assume because
    they are *flexible* and not tied to a particular way to go about
    establishing power or doing evil, they will be more resourceful and successful
    and pose a greater threat to the hero.

It looks like a pattern is emerging. The more axes on which a character is
defined, the less freedom that character will have to dance around the character
plane. A Lawful Good hero, for instance, might avoid Chaotic characters who
would otherwise help the hero bring about Good. The same hero might ignore Evil
characters who might be able to establish order.

We can imagine that characters defined on both axes have more *responsibility*
and are therefore less *flexible;* after all, wouldn't a character with a single
goal have better focus on their *one goal* and be willing to go further to
ensure their success?

## Pitfalls of the Rectangular Character Plane

Returning to the example of a Neutral Good protagonist who [mediates between
Lawful and Chaotic advisors][freud], there is clear potential for the sidekicks
to develop as characters. The Lawful advisor could enter the story as Lawful
Neutral and, the mediator-protagonist could, over the course of the work, bring
the sidekick closer to Lawful Good. The protagonist can turn the Lawful advisor
from a cold, calculating character to a more warm, relatable one.

This is just as true for a Chaotic advisor-sidekick, where the protagonist can
tame the character somewhat, teaching how use chaotic intrigue for good and
avoid [corruption][tvt for good regret]. They will surely still show their
chaotic side, and might end up at least being [tempted to stay][tvt choose to
stay] in the land at the end of [the hero's journey][tvt hero's journey].

We can see that **neutral characters have greater resolve along their only
defined axis.** In other words, Chaotic Neutral characters are more Chaotic than
others; Lawful Neutral characters more lawful; Neutral Good characters more
Good; and Neutral Evil characters more evil. Without the distraction and
responsibility of staying true to both axes, **neutral characters are more
flexible**. It's not that Lawful Neutral characters, for example, can't do
directly Good or directly Evil things, it's just that they don't do either for
the sake of being Good or Evil. They instead do whatever needs to be done to
accomplish their Lawful goals.

## A Better Geometric Distribution

If a rectangle is flawed, what could be better? Each section, I would argue,
should define the outermost limits of characters' own, uninfluenced decisions
under "normal" circumstances. Of course, characters can change, so this graph
would change as the story and the characters develop. Each alignment chart
_should_ be true at a certain point in the story, and should be denoted as such.

Here's what we have now:

![Traditional-Style Character Alignment][traditional]

This diagram really ought to account for the more restricted roles of characters
defined on both axes and the flexibility of neutral characters. We can try to
distort the rectangle a bit:

![Attempt at an Improved Rectangular Grid][distorted rectangular]

This clearly shows that the neutral characters can go further on the axis along
which they are neutral to accomplish their goals, but it doesn't account for the
fact that neutral characters are probably more resolved along their one defined
axis.

We're getting into space that can't be modelled by lines. What other way can we
express this? How about a _railroad model:_

![Railroad Model, an X inside a circle][railroad model]

Alignments in blue are defined on both axes, while alignments in white are
defined on only one. This solves some problems!

  - Neutral characters are more constrained on their defined axis and less
    constrained on the other axis
  - Characters defined on both axes are constrained to their two axes, with
    varying intensity. For a Lawful Evil character: no order without Evil, no
    Evil without order.

One importent caveat here: True Neutral (Neutral Neutral) doesn't belong on
graphs like these. True Neutral characters have some goal that is neither good
nor evil, and they will act the part of any alignment to achieve their goal. I
put it in the middle here because it was convenient and because I didn't want to
leave it out.

What do you think? Comments coming in an hour.
