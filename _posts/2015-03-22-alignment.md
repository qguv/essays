My friend [recently posted][the original] about [systems of alignment][WP
alignment] in tabletop role-playing games and referred to a conversation I had
with another friend. I feel I may have been taken out-of-context. To try to
clarify, I'll explain my views and conclusions here.

## Alignment and the 9-Cell Grid

Gary Gygax's 1978 update to the Player's Handbook for the release of _Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons_ introduced what we now know as the basic character
alignment system. The vertical axis represents the obvious and clichéd
Good/Evil dichotomy, but the horizontal axis represents a dichotomy between
Lawful characters, those who act predictably or stay within the confines of
what is acceptable, and Chaotic characters, those who don't.

The Web is full of completed 9-cell grids, classifying characters from a host
of media: films, books, television series. Here's one from _Breaking Bad,_ one
of very few shows whose main character isn't _Neutral Good_ or _Lawful Good:_

We get a sense from this diagram that the characters are well developed, and
that very different characters can complement each other nicely.

There are an endless number of these diagrams on the internet, ranging from the
[Original Star Trek][tos] to [Web browsers][browsers]. Many play with the
format of the 9-grid to fit more characters, like the character-heavy [Game of
Thrones][got-complex] (though I worry that Moral is being conflated with Lawful
here, compare a [simpler grid][got-simple]).

The labels themselves are a convenient way to both categorize characters within
a canon and group similar characters from different canons. Not only can we
talk about the group dynamics of the crew of the Serenity with respect to their
alignments, we can also make insightful comments about the similarities and
differences between portrayals of Chaotic Good in each Star Trek series. And if
I can elevate my Netflix habit to the domain of intellectual conversation,
it'll at least make me feel better about it.

## Not All Alignments Are Equal

TVTropes [tells us][tvt hero]:

> A Hero Protagonist is when The Hero and The Protagonist are the same person.
> This combination of roles is extremely common, to the point where it's
> considered true unless otherwise noted within any work. Simply put, the
> central character is also an established force for good within the universe.

This means that our protagonist is _probably_ going to end up on the top line
of our grid. She might be stuck up and/or reserved, which would put her in
clearly Lawful Good territory, or she might be edgy and a little rogue but with
a good heart, which would land her in the Chaotic Good box. If she has good
sidekicks that fill these boxes for her, she'll end up in the middle as Neutral
Good.

There are a couple spots on the grid which don't lead to very good
protagonists, mostly because they've become so clichéd or don't allow for
serious character development.

Let's say you're a writer and you want an interesting protagonist.

  - **Lawful Good** is out because it's boring and the character has nowhere to go but "down".
  - **Chaotic Good** is okay but you risk being too edgy and isolating the
    other real forces for Good in the story. You also risk being cliché-edgy.
    One way to write the antihero.
  - **Neutral Good** is a pretty good choice because it keeps your character
    *flexible* while maintaining the Hero-Protagonist role.
  - **Lawful Neutral** is a great choice because it sets your protagonist up to
    display and perhaps overcome her initial naïvité. This also forces the
    protagonist to do evil things sometimes, which keeps the character *flexible.*
  - **Chaotic Neutral** can be tough to write and risks being clichéd as the
    "troubled character" which can turn out as well (Jesse from Breaking Bad)
    as it can exhausting and flat (Cobb from Firefly). This character can also
    *develop,* is *flexible,* and can be convinced to fight for the good guys if
    it's risky or dangerous or wild enough for them. The other way to write the
    antihero.
  - **True Neutral** is probably not suitable for a protagonist, since it means
    that the character breaks the scale in one way or another; they're either
    very self-serving or focused on something very specific. Can be hard to relate
    to, but can be fascinating if played right.
  - **Lawful Evil** can be fun and terrifying to write and watch. _House of
    Cards_ abuses this alignment to great effect.
  - **Chaotic Evil** is generally stupid and overdone. It's not suitable for a
    protagonist, and chaotic evil characters aren't really good villains
    either. If they're truly evil _and_ chaotic, how could they have established
    the power necessary to pose a real threat, since this usually involves allying
    with the traditionally more powerful Lawful groups? Sometimes Chaotic Evil will
    pose as a final step before defeating the real mastermind.
  - **Neutral Evil** is the other really effective villain; we assume because
    they are *flexible* and not tied to a particular way to go about
    establishing power, doing evil, or what have you, they will be more successful
    and pose a greater threat to the Hero.

It looks like a pattern is emerging. The more axes on which a character is
defined, the less freedom that character will have to dance around the
character plane. A Lawful Good hero, for instance, might avoid Chaotic
characters who would otherwise help the hero bring about Good. The same hero
might ignore evil characters who might be able to establish order.

We can imagine that characters defined on both axes have more
**responsibility** and are therefore less **flexible;** after all, wouldn't a
character with a single goal have better focus on their **one goal** and be
willing to go further to ensure their success?
