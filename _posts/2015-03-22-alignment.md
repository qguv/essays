## The 2-dimensional Alignment Grid

Gary Gygax's 1978 update to the Player's Handbook for the release of _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_ introduced what we now know as the basic character alignment system. The vertical axis represents the obvious and clich√©d Good/Evil dichotomy, but the horizontal axis represents a dichotomy between Lawful characters, those who act predictably or stay within the confines of what is acceptable, and Chaotic characters, those who don't.

The Web is full of completed 9-cell grids, classifying characters from a host of media: films, books, television series. Here's one from _Breaking Bad,_ one of very few shows whose main character isn't _Neutral Good_ or _Lawful Good:_
